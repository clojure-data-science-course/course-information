* Clojure Data Science Course -- General Information

This repo holds general information about the Clojure Data Science Course that will begin in Tel Aviv towards the end of 2018.

The course is organized by our [[https://www.meetup.com/Clojure-Israel/][local meetup group]]. Several members have been contributing to the course.

** Meetings

[[https://www.meetup.com/Clojure-Israel/events/255927870/][Meeting A1]] - Nov 25th 2018

[[https://www.meetup.com/Clojure-Israel/events/256159018/][Meeting B1]] - Nov 28th 2018

** Intro 

Are you a data scientist or analyst looking for new tools and new ways of thought? Are you curious to know what Clojure is? Then this free course is for you.

Are you an experienced Clojurian, curious about data science? Then you are invited too -- you will probably find this interesting and useful as well.

Clojure is a programming language. It presents a unique blend of Computer Science paradigms, mainly Lisp and Functional Programming. It also offers a certain culture of thought, which calls for simplicity, focus on data, interactive experience and a dynamic flow of creativity. The fusion of all these allows for a rather joyful programming experience.

The purpose of this course is to study Clojure as a practical tool for data science.

** Goals
- Create a study group -- a team of people willing to think and learn together.
- Have fun.
- Learn new methods and tools.
- In few months, create a group of people who love to do data science using Clojure.

** What should I do to join the course?
- Please contact the [[https://www.meetup.com/Clojure-Israel/members/63580692/][course organizer]] in person.

** The format
- We will divide into two small groups, of up to 12 people each.
- Every 3 weeks we will have two meetings of identical content -- one for each group. At least one of them will be held in English.
- In about 6 meetings, people should gain some reasonable practical independence with the language.
- We will have at least 12 meetings -- that is, till the middle of the summer. Then, we may decide to continue with more advanced topics.
- On the first meetings, the first hour will be for beginners' material. People who feel more experienced will be able to join at the beginning of the second hour.

** Homework
- We will have practical homework tasks. They may include some reading.
- We will discuss the homework at some common web space.
- After several meetings, we may suggest some optional larger home project.

** Time
- Group A meetings: Sunday 18:00-21:00 every 3 weeks.
- Group B meetings: Wednesday 18:00-21:00 every 3 weeks.
- If people feel like it, we will have occasional meetings for doing homework and training together.

** Place
Madlan (Localize.city) offices at Yigal Alon St 57, Tel Aviv.

** Recommended reading

If you feel stuck or are facing any difficulty with your reading -- let us talk!

*** Learning Clojure
**** Clojure for the Brave and True
 [[https://www.braveclojure.com/clojure-for-the-brave-and-true/][This]] book by Daniel Higginbotham ([[https://twitter.com/nonrecursive?lang=en][@nonrecursive]]) is an excellent way to prepare for the course. Several of us used it as a first book for Clojure. The most relevant chapters are 1,3,4,5,(6),9,11,12.

**** Clojurebridge
 [[https://twitter.com/clojurebridge][ClojureBridge]] is an [[https://clojurebridge.org/][organization]] aiming at making Clojure more accessible to underrepresented groups in tech. It has been organizing workshops in different places during the last several years.
 They wrote [[https://clojurebridge.org/curriculum/#/][this]] short beginner-friendly presentation.

**** Practicalli Clojure
 [[https://practicalli.github.io/clojure/][This]] is a new book by John Stevenson ([[https://twitter.com/jr0cket][@jr0cket]]), under construction. It is part of the [[http://www.practical.li/][Practical.li]] series. You may find its first few sections useful as a guide for building your learning process and for finding other resources.

*** Documentation

**** ClojureDocs
     [[https://clojuredocs.org/][This]] project is the main place to go.

*** Data science with Clojure
Here are some blogs to follow:
- [[https://dragan.rocks/][dragan.rocks]] by [[https://twitter.com/draganrocks][Dragan Djuric]] for linear algebra, high performance computing, etc.
- [[http://gigasquidsoftware.com/#/blog/archives/index][Squid's Blog]] by [[https://twitter.com/carinmeier][Carin Meier]] for machine learning and artificial intelligence.


** Tools

Here are some suggestions for the software tools that you may use in the course. If you have any difficulty -- then let us talk.

*** The minimum
You will at least need 

*** Notebooks
In most of our talks will use [[http://jupyter.org/][Jupyter]] notebooks -- not because we beleive it is the best tool, but because it is comfortable for didactic purposes.

One way to use them is [[http://beakerx.com/][BeakerX]]. However, in this course we will prefer [[https://github.com/clojupyter/lein-jupyter][lein-jupyter]] (which is more 


 - We will also suggest a more complete development environment -- probably with VSCode.

 Higginbotham's book recommends the wonderful Emacs editor. Eventough it is wonderful, and arguably the best way to do programming, in this course we will use other tools, which are more beginner-friendly: Jupyter and VSCode.

 For your practice at home, you may also use the following:
 - [[https://sekao.net/nightcode/][Nightcode]] - a minimalistic and easy-to-install development environment for Clojure.
 - [[https://repl.it/languages/clojure][repl.it]] - here you can try the language online.

 Please tell if you have any questions about these.

[[https://practicalli.github.io/clojure/development-tools/][This]] guide seggests several of the well-known tools 

** Keep in touch
- We use this [[https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/clojure-data-science-course-tlv][discussion mail group]].
- We will also set a web space place for chat-like discussions.
