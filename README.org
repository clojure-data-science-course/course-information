** Goals
- Create a study group willing to think and learn together.
- Have fun.
- Learn new methods and tools.
- In few months, create a group of people who love to do data science using Clojure.

** The format
- We will divide into two small groups, of up to 12 people each.
- Every 3 weeks we will have two meetings of identical content - one for each group. At least one of them will be held in English.
- In about 6 meetings, peole should gain some reasonable practical independence with the language.
- We will have at least 12 meetings - that is, till the middle of the summer. Then, we may decide to continue with more advanced topics.
- Usually, the first hour of meetings will be directed at beginners. People who feel more experienced can join later.

** Homework
- We will have practical homework tasks. In the beginning, they may include some reading.
- We will discuss the homework at some common web space.
- After several meetings, we may suggest some optional larger home project.

** Time
**NOTE THIS**
- Group A meetings: Sunday 18:00-21:00 every 3 weeks.
- Group B meetings: Wednesday 18:00-21:00 every 3 weeks.
- If people feel like it, we will set occasional meetings for doing homework togetehr, and training together.
