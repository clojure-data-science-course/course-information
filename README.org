* **TENTATIVE PLAN**
* Clojure Data Science Course -- General Information

This repo holds general information about the Clojure Data Science Course that will begin in Tel Aviv towards the end of 2018.

The course is organized by our [[https://www.meetup.com/Clojure-Israel/][local meetup group]]. Several members have been contributing to the course.

* Intro 

Are you a data scientist or analyst looking for new tools and new ways of thought? Are you curious to know what Clojure is? Then this free course is for you.

Are you an experienced Clojurian, curious about data science? Then you are invited too -- you will probably find this interesting and useful as well.

Clojure is a programming language. It presents a unique blend of Computer Science paradigms, mainly Lisp and Functional Programming. It also offers a certain culture of thought, which calls for simplicity, focus on data, interactive experience and a dynamic flow of creativity. The fusion of all these allows for a rather joyful programming experience.

The purpose of this course is to study Clojure as a practical tool for data science.

** Goals
- Create a study group -- a team of people willing to think and learn together.
- Have fun.
- Learn new methods and tools.
- In few months, create a group of people who love to do data science using Clojure.

** What should I do to join the course?
- Contact the [[https://www.meetup.com/Clojure-Israel/members/63580692/][course organizer]] in person.

** The format
- We will divide into two small groups, of up to 12 people each.
- Every 3 weeks we will have two meetings of identical content -- one for each group. At least one of them will be held in English.
- In about 6 meetings, people should gain some reasonable practical independence with the language.
- We will have at least 12 meetings -- that is, till the middle of the summer. Then, we may decide to continue with more advanced topics.
- On the first meetings, the first hour will be for beginners' material. People who feel more experienced will be able to join at the beginning of the second hour.

** Homework
- We will have practical homework tasks. They may include some reading.
- We will discuss the homework at some common web space.
- After several meetings, we may suggest some optional larger home project.

** **NOTE THIS**
** Time
- Group A meetings: Sunday 18:00-21:00 every 3 weeks. Another alternative: Fri 9:00-12:00 -- which is better for you?
- Group B meetings: Wednesday 18:00-21:00 every 3 weeks.
- If people feel like it, we will have occasional meetings for doing homework and training together.

** Place
Madlan (Localize.city) offices at Yigal Alon St 57, Tel Aviv.

** Tentative Course Plan
Everything here may change after more thought and discussion.
*** Essential Topics

     - higher order function
     - parallel computing
     - example: basic web scraping
     - basic statistics
     - visualization with [[https://github.com/metasoarous/oz][Oz]]
**** Functional Programming
     - a closer look at higher order functions
     - example: data cleaning and processing
     - discussion of FP
     - powerful data manipulation with [[https://github.com/nathanmarz/specter][Specter]]
     - example: more web scraping
**** Machine Learning through Java Interop
     - intro to the JVM
     - working with Java classes, objects and methods
     - example: basic machine learning
     - representing your experiment plan with data
     - using synthetic random data to verify your models
     - the [[http://haifengl.github.io/smile/][Smile]] library
     - more visualization
**** Writing an algorithm: decomplecting the complicated
     - example: genetic algotithms
     - a more complete dev setup (probably with VSCode)
     - using [[https://github.com/tonsky/datascript][Datascript]] to organize and query your data
     - existing libraries for genetic algorithms
     - writing our own algorithm
**** R interop
     - working with R from Clojure
     - basic probability and statistics
     - visualizations: ggplot2, R's htmlwidgets, plotly, leaflet
     - example: probabilistic modelling
**** Asynchronous processes
     - channels
     - transducers
     - example: statistics of streaming data
     - example: reinforcement learning with some Toy UI

*** Additional Topics
Here the order of classes is not known yet.
**** Interactive dashboards with Clojurescript
**** High performance computing
- The [[https://uncomplicate.org/][Uncomplicate]] collection of libraries
**** Distributed Computing
- [[http://www.onyxplatform.org/][The Onyx platform]]
**** Databases
**** Python interop
**** Probabilistic Programming
- Intro to Bayesian reasoning
- [[https://probprog.github.io/anglican/index.html][Anglican]]
- Other options
**** NLP
**** Logic programming
**** Deep learning with Clojure MXNet
**** Network analysis
**** Computer Vision
**** Time Series analysis
**** Spatial data

** Forum / Chat
- We are still trying to figure out which web space place would be the best for group discussions.
- We would love to hear your opinions here -- what should we use: A Reddit Channel? Clojureverse? IRC? Discord?

** Tooling
- Most of the talks will use Jupyter notebooks - not because we beleive it is the best tool, but because it is comfortable for didactic purposes.
- We will also suggest a more complete development environment.
- We would love to hear your opinion here -- which one is the most beginner friendly: Nightcode? Atom? VSCode?
